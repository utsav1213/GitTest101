What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) used to track changes in files and coordinate work among multiple developers. It stores the entire project history on every user's machine, enabling offline work and seamless collaboration. Git is widely adopted and powers platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Advantages of Git Over Other Version Control Systems:

-Distributed Architecture:

Every user has a complete copy of the repository, including the full history.
Allows offline access and faster operations compared to centralized systems.

-Efficient Branching and Merging:

Git makes branching lightweight and fast, supporting experimentation and parallel development.
Merging branches is robust, with tools to resolve conflicts efficiently.
Speed and Performance:

Most operations are local, making Git significantly faster than centralized systems.

-Security:

Git uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-1) to ensure the integrity of data and commits.
Community and Ecosystem:

Extensive support, tutorials, and integration with tools like GitHub, GitLab, and CI/CD pipelines.

-Flexibility:

Can handle large-scale projects with millions of files and commits.
Compatible with various workflows (centralized, distributed, etc.).
