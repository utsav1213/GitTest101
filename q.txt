What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is primarily used in software development to manage source code, but it can also be applied to any type of document or file where changes need to be tracked, such as text documents, configuration files, or design assets.

Why is Version Control Important?

Collaboration: Enables multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.
History Tracking: Maintains a history of all changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions.
Backup: Acts as a backup system, storing all project versions securely.
Experimentation: Allows creating branches to test new features or changes without affecting the main codebase.

How Does Version Control Work?
-Snapshots: Changes are saved as commits, which can be reverted if needed.
-Branching: Allows parallel work and experimentation without affecting the main project.
-Popular Tools: Git (with GitHub, GitLab) and SVN are widely used for distributed and centralized workflows.
